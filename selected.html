                   for my web development and design course. it is mandatory for someone who wanted to be

               <li>
                   I read many philosophical and novel books for my general knowledge. some of them if I wanted to list
                   some of them include aliweledim, dem bedem, yaltenore liginet, kedit wede matu, efoyita,
                   keaddimas bashager, haddis, yanna mastawesh and many other books are intersestedme.
               </li>
               <li>In the next two years I am going to read many books from novel to academic books because books
                   are the one which gives strength and flexibility to our mind like food gives to all other parts of 
                   the body. so reading books is the best way to increase our mindset. Reading is not for anly for 
                   colege examinations but we must read all the time. having a good grade in colege is not like having
                   great knowlege about that subject.

               <li>
                       As I read books and magazines and any other written material I waw also have time
                       for playing and taking time with friends. I play football at the weekend and basket 
                       ball every day at the morning. sometimes we play table tennis with my friends. playing 
                       football gives me a good recreation than every thing. when I feel depresed I went to play 
                       table tennis.
